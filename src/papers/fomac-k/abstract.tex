We present the textual wide-spectrum modeling and programing language
\Klang{}, which has been designed for representing graphical \sysml{}
models, in order to provide semantics to \sysml{}, and pave the way
for analysis of \sysml{} models. The current version is supported by
the \zthree{} SMT theorem prover, which allows to prove consistency of
constraints. The language is intended to be used by engineers for
designing space missions, and in particular NASA's planned mission to
Jupiter's moon Europa. One of the challenges facing software
development teams is the notion of change: the fact that code changes
over time, and the subsequent problem of demonstrating that no harm
has been done due to a change. \Klang{} is in this paper being applied
to demonstrate how change can be perceived as a software verification
problem, and hence verified using more traditional software
verification techniques.
