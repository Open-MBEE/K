\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have addressed the topic of {\em change} in a
software/modeling development environment. More generally, we
have developed what we refer to as a  {\em development language} 
for modeling as well as programming, also referred to as a 
wide spectrum programming language, with verification support. 
This enables developers to easily study properties of their models and programs, 
and in particular, in this case, the effect of their change, thus helping to
avoid making changes that could potentially lead to unsatisfiability
and inconsistencies. We have studied various types of problems, and how
consistency checking and change as {\em refinement} can be applicable
for each of those scenarios. While the topic of change itself is
extremely broad, we believe that a language oriented approach as
presented in this paper provides concrete value and provides a good
foundation for developing stronger techniques.

Chris Delp and Bradley Clement for the opportunities and insights they
provided during the development of the \Klang{} language.
