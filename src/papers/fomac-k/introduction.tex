\section{Introduction}

The core topic of this paper is the concept of {\em change}, and how it
relates to the way we {\em model} as well as {\em program} our systems, and how 
we can ensure correctness of change using modern verification technology.
We shall specifically discuss this topic by introducing the wide-spectrum
modeling and programming language \Klang, under development at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL), and demonstrate change scenarios and their 
verification in \Klang.

The first call for opinion statements on the topic of change, with this 
journal in mind, was published in \cite{steffen-isola-2014}, in which it is 
characterized as ``{\em a discipline for rigorously dealing with the nature of 
today's agile system development, which is characterized by unclear premises, 
unforeseen change, and the need for fast reaction, in a context of hard to 
control frame conditions, like third party components, network-problem, and 
attacks}''.

Our view is that change fundamentally can be considered as a software 
verification problem, where the question is the following: given a program 
$P_1$, and a new program $P_2$, does $P_2$ implement/refine $P_1$?
As such, in the extreme, the topic of correctness under change can  potentially be 
considered as the well known topic of correctness. 

As is well known, analysis of correctness can be performed dynamically by analyzing 
execution traces. Dynamic methods include such topics 
as testing, runtime verification, and specification mining, where learned models of 
previous behavior is compared to models of current behavior (after change). Dynamic 
methods are known to scale well, which is their attraction, but are also known to 
yield false negatives: not to report errors that exist, and in some cases (i.e. runtime analysis of data races and deadlocks) to yield 
false positives (to report errors that do not exist). Our focus
in this paper is on static analysis of code: where proofs are carried out on the basis 
of the structure of the code.

The \Klang{} language is being developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),
as part of a larger effort at JPL to develop an in-house systems modeling language and 
associated tool set, referred to as \ems{} (Engineering Modeling System). \ems{} is 
based on the graphical \sysml{} formalism \cite{sysml}, which is a variant of \uml{} 
\cite{uml}, both designed by the OMG (Object Management Group) technology standards 
consortium. \sysml{} is meant for systems development more broadly considered, 
including physical systems as well as software systems, in contrast to \uml{}, which 
is mainly meant for software development. 
\ems{} is being developed (and already in use) to support the design of NASA's 
upcoming mission to Jupiter's Moon Europa, referred to as the {\em Europa Clipper 
mission} \cite{europa-clipper}, planned to launch around 2022 at the 
moment of writing.

The \Klang{} language design was initially triggered by a desire from within
the \ems{} project to create a textual version of \sysml. Although the graphical
nature of \sysml{} can be attractive from a readability point of view, it 
suffers from a number of issues, including lack of clear semantics, lack of analysis 
capabilities, requiring heavy mouse-movement and clicking, and generally demanding
much more visual space than a textual formalism. The \Klang{} language is in addition 
inspired by the idea of combining modeling and programming into one
language. This idea has been, and is being, pursued by others in various forms, including past works on wide-spectrum specification languages. See the
related work section (Section \ref{sec:related-work}) for a more detailed 
discussion. It is interesting to observe, that modern programming languages to an increasing degree look and feel like specification languages from the past. 

A constantly returning discussion point in the design of \Klang{} has been whether to 
actually design a new language or adopt an existing specification or programming 
language. The decision to design a new language was in part influenced by the felt 
need (perhaps unwarranted) to control the syntax and the tool development stack,
including parsers, compilers, etc. Whether this decision was/is correct, an important 
factor that makes \Klang{} interesting is that it is being designed 
to meet the needs of a real space mission. As such it can be considered as
a confirmation of already existing work in the area of specification as well as 
programming languages.

The contents of the paper is as follows. 
Section \ref{sec:k} introduces the \Klang{} language, focusing on a small
analyzable subset, which is currently being tested during the initial 
design phase of the Europa
Clipper mission.
Section \ref{sec:change} discusses various aspects of change by formalizing
them in \Klang.
Section \ref{sec:related-work} outlines related work, and 
Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.
Appendix \ref{app:grammar} contains the grammar for \Klang{} in \antlr{} 
\cite{antlr} format.
